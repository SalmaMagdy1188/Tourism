           <h3 style= "font-size: 20px;"> The Basics of Tourism <br></h3>

            Tourism refers to the act of traveling for business or leisure purposes to a location away from your hometown or usual area. As a tourist, you visit a location that's away from your normal area. The World Tourism Organization (WTO) specifically defined tourism as the practice of staying outside your usual environment for one year or less if it's for leisure purposes or 24 hours or less if it's for business purposes.

         <h1 style="text-decoration: underline rgb(103, 106, 117);">How Big Is The Tourism Industry?</h1>
         <blockquote style="font-size: large;">
            The tourism industry is absolutely huge. In 2012, the number of international tourists reached the 1 billion mark for the first time. Since then, the number of international tourists has only increased. As a result, many people are eager to start a career in the tourism industry.

            But its massive size is just one reason to consider a career in the tourism industry. Tourism businesses include hotels, resorts, cruise ships, spas and bed and breakfasts, all of which offer a relaxing and enjoyable environment in which to work. Furthermore, tourism businesses are often located in scenic vacation areas, which isn't found in most industries.

         <h2 style="text-decoration: underline rgb(103, 106, 117);">Inbound vs Outbound Tourism: What's the Difference?</h2>
         <blockquote style="font-size: large;">
            There are different forms of tourism, including inbound and outbound tourism. So, what's the difference between inbound and outbound tourism? Inbound tourism involves foreign tourists visiting a country, whereas outbound tourism involves resident tourists leaving their home country to visit a different country.

            Inbound tourism in the United States, for example, involves non-U.S. residents visiting the United States for business or leisure purposes. Outbound tourism in the United States, on the other hand, refers to U.S. residents leaving the United States to visit a different country for business or leisure purposes.

         <h3>-Domestic Tourism Explained</h3>
         <blockquote style="font-size: large;">
            A third form if tourism is domestic tourism. Domestic tourism occurs when a resident tourist visits a location within his or her home country. In the United States, domestic tourism occurs when a U.S. resident visits a location in the United States for business or leisure purposes. Of course, the destination must still be away from the tourist's hometown or usual area. Otherwise, it's not considered tourism.
